# Chateau: Decorated Tower

Chateau provides traits and primitives which are useful for building clients and servers on top of Tokio and Tower.

It is split out from [hyperdriver][], which is focused on HTTP clients and servers, becasue there are aspects of
the framework that are useful outside of the HTTP context.
